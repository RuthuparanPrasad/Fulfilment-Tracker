# Apprentice Fulfilment Tracker Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end automated data pipeline and dashboard that tracks apprentice fulfilment progress using real-time (sample) data from Google Sheets.

It includes:
- Dynamic data extraction from Google Sheets using Python and `gspread`
- Data cleaning and transformation (e.g. tracking days to diagnostic, assignment, and onboarding)
- Local storage into a SQLite database (`fulfilment_tracker.db`)
- A fully interactive Metabase dashboard running on Docker
- 🖥One-click Python script (`run_dashboard.py`) to process data, launch Metabase, and open the dashboard on `localhost:3000`

This is ideal for demoing how data automation and self-serve analytics can be deployed quickly and effectively — without the cloud.
