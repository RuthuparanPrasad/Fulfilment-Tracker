# Apprentice Fulfilment Tracker Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end automated data pipeline and dashboard that tracks apprentice fulfilment progress using real-time (sample) data from Google Sheets.

It includes:
- ðŸ“„ Dynamic data extraction from Google Sheets using Python and `gspread`
- ðŸ§¹ Data cleaning and transformation (e.g. tracking days to diagnostic, assignment, and onboarding)
- ðŸ’¾ Local storage into a SQLite database (`fulfilment_tracker.db`)
- ðŸ“Š A fully interactive Metabase dashboard running on Docker
- ðŸ–¥ One-click Python script (`run_dashboard.py`) to process data, launch Metabase, and open the dashboard on `localhost:3000`

This is ideal for demoing how data automation and self-serve analytics can be deployed quickly and effectively.
